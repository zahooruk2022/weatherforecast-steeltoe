# Steeltoe weatherforecast-steeltoe Accelerator

A sample accelerator for Steeltoe.

This sample is based on the Weather Forecast RESTful API application made available from Microsoft.

The application also includes several Steeltoe features: management endpoints, dynamic logging, and distributed tracing.

The starting source for this sample was created using:
```
$ dotnet new steeltoe-webapi --logging-dynamic-logger --management-endpoints --distributed-tracing
```

## Running the app locally

To run the sample application:

```
$ dotnet run
```

For more details on Steeltoe endpoints, visit https://docs.steeltoe.io/.

## Deploying to Kubernetes as a TAP workload with Tanzu CLI

> NOTE: The provided `config/workload.yaml` file uses the Git URL for this sample. When you want to modify the source, you must push the code to your own Git repository and then update the `spec.source.git` information in the `config/workload.yaml` file.
If you make modifications to the source, push these changes to your own Git repository.

When you are done developing your app, you can simply deploy it using:

```
tanzu apps workload apply -f config/workload.yaml
```

If you would like deploy the code from your local working directory you can use the following command:

```
tanzu apps workload create weatherforecast-steeltoe -f config/workload.yaml \
  --local-path . \
  --source-image <REPOSITORY-PREFIX>/weatherforecast-steeltoe-source \
  --type web
```

## Accessing the app deployed to your cluster

Determine the URL to use for the accessing the app by running:

```
tanzu apps workload get weatherforecast-steeltoe
```

To access the deployed app use the URL shown under "Workload Knative Services" and append the endpoint `/weatherforecast` to that URL.

This depends on the TAP installation having DNS configured for the Knative ingress.

## Deploying to Cloud Foundry

Publish the application locally using the .NET cli. The following command will create a publish folder automatically:

```
dotnet publish -o publish weatherforecast-steeltoe.csproj
```

Push the app to Cloud Foundry:

```
cf push weatherforecast-steeltoe -p ./publish --random-route
```

## Accessing the app deployed to your cluster

Determine the URL to use for accessing the app by running:

```
cf apps
```

To access the deployed app use the URL shown under "routes" and append the endpoint `/weatherforecast` to that URL.
